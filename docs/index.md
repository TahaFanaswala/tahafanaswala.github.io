# Getting started on FTW Trading

While the images in this guide are from the PC version, these steps apply to the mobile application as well
## Step 1: Buying shares
When you launch the app for the first time, you'll land on the **Ownership** page. This is where you can see what shares you own. It's currently blank, but we can change that by buying some shares. Click on the **Transactions** button at the bottom, to the left of the **Ownership** button.

To file a new transaction, you will need to
1. Choosing Buy or Sell
2. Which league (for now it is just the NFL, but we plan on incorporating other leagues soon)
3. Which team you want to transact
4. How many shares

After filling out the form, you can then see how many credits you will earn/lose after the transaction is completed. You can also view how many available credits you currently have, and how many shares of the selected team you can sell. Note that you can only successfully file a transaction if the blue button at the bottom says "Valid". If you don't have enough credits to complete a transaction or try to sell more shares of a team than you own, the button will say "Invalid", and will not let you file the transaction. 

Here is an example of a completed, valid transaction
