# Getting started on FTW Trading

While the images in this guide are from the PC version, these steps apply to the mobile application as well
## Step 1: Buying shares
When you launch the app for the first time, you'll land on the **Ownership** page. This is where you can see what shares you own. It's currently blank, but we can change that by buying some shares. Click on the **Transactions** button at the bottom, to the left of the **Ownership** button.
